## Current Project Standards

### Code Standards
1. **Language**: Rust (2021 edition)
2. **Structure**: Modular approach with well-defined components
3. **Testing**: Unit tests required for all modules
4. **Documentation**: In-code documentation with Rust doc comments
5. **Error Handling**: Using `thiserror` and `anyhow` crates for robust error management
6. **Async**: Using Tokio for asynchronous operations

### Documentation Standards
1. **Format**: Markdown (.md) files organized by topic
2. **Structure**: Consistent headers and sections across documents
3. **Code Examples**: Included in documentation where relevant
4. **Cross-Referencing**: Documents reference each other for related topics

### Development Workflow
1. **Version Control**: Git with feature branches
2. **Code Reviews**: Required before merging to main branches
3. **Issue Tracking**: Organized by module and priority
4. **Release Cycle**: Planning for versioned releases

### Architecture Principles
1. **Mathematical Foundation**: All protocols based on mathematical principles
2. **Decentralization**: No central points of control
3. **Security**: Built-in at every layer
4. **Adaptability**: Dynamic protocol generation based on network conditions
5. **Compatibility**: Interoperability with existing internet infrastructure
6. **Performance**: Focus on low latency and high throughput

## Next Milestone Targets
1. Complete implementation of all critical core modules
2. Finalize the Enhanced Protocol Suite
3. Demonstrate real-world performance improvements
4. Begin integration with existing network infrastructure
5. Deploy test networks with observer consensus
